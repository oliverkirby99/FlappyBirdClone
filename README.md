# FlappyBirdClone
 Made with Unity. A basic FlappyBirdClone I made by using what I have learnt. No help or research was required.

To play the game: download the project as a .zip
Extract to desktop (or any location)
Run: \FlappyBirdClone-main\My Project

To view the scripts etc.
\FlappyBirdClone-main\My project\Assets\Scripts


I think I set this Repo up badly/incorrectly. If/when I upload another project, I will aim to do it properly.
